# Velveteen Ensemble
A music group that performs for weddings, corporate events, and can be booked for concerts, tours, and recording sessions. 

The main focus of this site is to create a proffessional and modern representation of this company so people know what to expect when hiring them to perform at different venues.



This site is built with **Rails 5.1.6** and is using **AWS S3** as media storage, allowing for better quality images and faster playback of music and videos.

The new site was started by entering:
    ```
    rails new Velveteen -d postgresql
    ```
into the terminal, which prepares it for being launched on heroku without having to worry about switching to postgresql later on.

The homepage has a slideshow of photos and videos highlighting different buttons at different times of playback.
